**Developer**

I have 6 years of experience, dropped out of college during the pandemic and have contributed to a Software House, a logistics company, and now I'm with the Haytek team revolutionizing the optical market serving customers throughout Brazil.   
**My interest is to transform code into value**.

## Professional Experience

### [Haytek](https://haytek.com.br/)
B2B e-commerce, where I've been for 4 years.

**Senior Developer** • Apr. 2024 - present   
>As a senior I had the opportunity to increase scalability and resilience
with asynchronous architecture in contexts of high coupling and low SLA, 
thus making the product more efficient. I actively participated in implementing observability, with APM, logs and dashboards shedding light on metrics like latency and throughput of services.

**Mid-level Developer** • Jan. 2022 - Sep. 2024    
>As a mid-level I worked on a very strong refactoring and performance optimization job. 
The e-commerce couldn't handle its number of active users, 
it was my responsibility to actively recognize 
and improve queries that could be optimized, functionalities that could be degraded, 
inefficient algorithms.

**Junior Developer** • Jul. 2021 - Jan. 2022

>I had to adapt to stored procedures running inside a Microsoft SQL Server, and a Python Flask monolith that made use of these procedures. I was hired to participate in the team that would take the e-commerce to Google Cloud Platform and this monolith into microservices using NodeJS and MongoDB.


### [Clique Retire](https://www.cliqueretire.com.br/)

Smart lockers for logistics, retail, condominiums and services.

**Senior Developer** • Oct. 2020 - Jul. 2021  
>Implementation of integration for a new delivery option 
in VTEX and Shopify stores using Clique Retire's smart lockers, 
working with proprietary frameworks like VtexIO and Shopify Liquid.

**Junior Developer** • Feb. 2020 - Oct. 2020  
>Full stack projects with DynamoDB, AWS Lambda and Node.

### [Sonata](https://sonatalab.com/)
